# Designing-patterns


## Single Responsibilty principle: 
   It says your code only serve purpose that it is suppose to serve. For ex: lets say we are making a journal and in which we are only keeping the entries i.e. it is their sole purpose. Now if you also waant to save the journal in file, you can do this but that is not journal responsibility if you want to persist something you can create another field persistance whose responsibilty to save any object i.e book, journal into the file then it makes more sense
